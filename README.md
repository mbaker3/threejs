Three.js Experiements
=============
A collection of random three.js experiments.

Box Wave
-------------
A simple grid of boxes which use perlin noise to affect the height of each box. This creates the sort of wave effect you see. The color of each box's material also responds to the sampled perlin value creating lighter patches when lower and darker patches when higher.

Mouse collision detection has also been added showing both the closest point hit (green) as well as all other boxes hit (yellow).
